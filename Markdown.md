## Markdown

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports *HTML* Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
